# mini_project_on_DIP
This is a mini project on Digital Image Processing for my academic purpose.
This project is to extract the text from the image and convert it into 'pdf' or 'doc' format. 

Let's see what are the requirement libraries for this project.
>pillow == '9.2.0'
>pytesseract == '0.3.10'
>easygui == '0.98.3'
>sys 
>os
>tkinter
>fpdf == '1.7.2'
>docx == '0.2.4'

Tkinter:
Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.

Tkinter is not the only GUI Programming toolkit for Python. It is however the most commonly used one. CameronLaird calls the yearly decision to keep TkInter "one of the minor traditions of the Python world." Using Tkinter, the GUI was designed for the interaction. 

Pytesseract:
Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and “read” the text embedded in images.

Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google’s Tesseract-OCR Engine. It is also useful as a stand-alone invocation script to tesseract, as it can read all image types supported by the Pillow and Leptonica imaging libraries, including jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, and others.

Pillow:
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
